h2 Variables

p
  | There are multiple options to define a variable, its choice depends on
  | its #[em scope ]. The limits of a variable are generally defined by
  | curly brackets i.e. #[code.o-code--inline {}]; otherwise, they are
  | <em>global</em>. The following code consolidates the idea:

pre
  code.o-code
    :highlight(lang="javascript")
      const star = 'sun'
      function country () {
        var hills = true
        if (hills) {
          let animal = 'bear'
        }
      }

p
  | Additionally, features such as: are #[em hoisted] (interprets the
  | declaration at the top level of the scope and ignores the declaration
  | point) or creates properties when the declaration is in the global
  | scope, will determine which variables to use.
